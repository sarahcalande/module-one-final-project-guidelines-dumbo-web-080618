This is an app that allows a user to find out what there is to do in New York and when. The user can create an account with an email and name, and use this to log in and out. They have the option of choosing from a list of things to do including going dancing, going to a sports event, a bar, a museum, a park, a concert, or a public event. The user has the option to set their budget and are returned suggestions with place, day, and best time to go based on their selected activity and budget range. For example, if they chose to go to a bar costing under $20, they will be returned options of $20 and under bars which may include a rooftop bar, a speakeasy, a cocktail bar, or a beer bar. The user can then save these activities in their list of saved choices and access or delete their saved choices when they login again.


This app is accessed in the terminal by forking and cloning from github, CDing into the project, and running "ruby/run.rb"
